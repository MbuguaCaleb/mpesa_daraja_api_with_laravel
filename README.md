**Json Encode vs Json decode**

```

Whenever i JSON encode i am converting an array or object to JSON.

When ever in JSON decode i am converting a JSON object into a variable


N/B

JSON Is the data Interchange format used in Http.

JSON data is more like a string and not an Object or an array and therefore once
i receive it i must Docode it.
